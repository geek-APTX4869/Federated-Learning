# Federated-Learning

Simulation of federated learning.  
You can see utils/options.py to view detailed parameters and their interpretations.  
Since there is no optimization, it is time-consuming when there are more users selected.      
## Requirements  
python>=3.6  
pytorch>=0.5  
## Run  
A simple example:  
You can run in terminal with code  
`python main_fed.py --iid --epochs 40`
